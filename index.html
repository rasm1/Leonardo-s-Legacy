                <p>
                    Leonardo da Vinci is one of history's most celebrated polymaths,
                    known for his remarkable contributions to art, science, engineering, and anatomy during the Italian
                    Renaissance.
                    His innovative approach to the arts and science have caused him to become a leading figure in the
                    fields of painting,
                    sculpture, engineering, and invention. <br>
                    Leonardo was more than just an artistic genius, his work in fields such as anatomy and engineering
                    have laid the groundwork for
                    future scientific advancements.
                    He meticulously studied human and animal anatomy, creating detailed sketches that were
                    centuries ahead of their time.
                    His engineering concepts, such as flying machines and war devices, showcase his inventive spirit and
                    visionary thinking.
                    Leonardo da Vinci embodies the quintessential "Renaissance Man," a term used to describe individuals
                    with wide-ranging interests and expertise.
                    His legacy endures through his art, scientific investigations, and the inspiration he continues to
                    provide to artists, scientists, and thinkers across the globe.

                <h2>early life</h2>
                <p>
                    <!-- da Vinci was born on 15th of april 1452 near the town of Vinci in the region of Tuscany. <br>
                        His father Piero da Vinci, worked as a legal notary (a sort of lawyer) and his mother Caterina
                        di Meo lippi was from the lower class. <br>
                        Leonardo was born out of wedlock, which was quite damning in those times. <br>
                        Leonardo's artistic talents had been recognised from an early age and thus he was taken in as an
                        assistant at the age of 14 by Andrea del Verrocchio. <br> -->

                    Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15th, 1452, in Vinci, a rural village in Tuscany, Italy.
                    His full name was Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, which indicates to us that he was the
                    illegitimate son of
                    Piero da Vinci, a notary, and Caterina, a woman of the lower class. <br>
                    Despite being an illegitimate, Leonardo was raised in his father's household, where he received
                    an informal education in reading, writing, and arithmetic.
                    Growing up in rural Vinci, Leonardo was surrounded by the beauty of nature, which likely formed
                    his interests and enhanced is oberservational skills. <br>
                    He spent much of his youth exploring the countryside, examining
                    plants, animals, and the environment, learning as much as he could in the process.
                    This early exposure to the natural world later became a significant influence on his work in
                    both art and science. <br>
                    At the age of 14, Leonardo moved to Florence, where he began his apprenticeship with the
                    renowned artist Andrea del Verrocchio, an important step in his artistic development.
                    Under Verrocchio's guidance, Leonardo learned various artistic techniques and crafts, such as
                    painting, sculpture, metalworking, and drafting.
                    During this apprenticeship, he also honed his observational skills further and developed a deep
                    appreciation for the beauty of arts and sciences. <br>
                    By his early 20s, Leonardo's talent was becoming apparent, and he began receiving commissions
                    for his own works.
                    This early period of his life laid the foundation for his later achievements, as he combined his
                    artistic skills with his passion for science, engineering, and anatomy.
                    These formative years in Florence set the stage for Leonardo da Vinci's emergence as one of the
                    most versatile and innovative minds of the Italian Renaissance.

                    <h2>The Mona Lisa</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> The Mona Lisa, perhaps the most famous artwork ever created. The Mona Lisa was
                        painted approximately painted between the years of 1503 & 1506 and
                        The painting is supossedly a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the 3rd wife of the client Francesco
                        del
                        Giocondo. The Mona Lisa is an oil painting made using poplarwood.
                        Much is left unknown about this masterpiece, yet this is one of the only artworks where
                        historians
                        are sure that it was painted by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci himself.</p>

                    <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> The Last supper is a mural painting created by da Vinci, made in the years of 1495- 1498, housed
                        in
                        the refectory of the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan.
                        The painting represents the last Supper of jesus and his 12 apostles as told in the Gospel of
                        John,
                        where jesus tells his apostles that one of them will betray him.
                        The painting combines a miriad of considerations to produce a masterpiece. This artpiece clearly
                        displays da Vinci's mastery over elements such as handling of space,
                        displays of human emotion and treatment of motion to produce what you see in front of you today.
                        Recognised by even the most astute artists, the last supper has gone into history
                        as one of the great works of man.</p>

                    <h2>The Vetruvian Man</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p> This is another one of Leonardo da Vinci’s famous works and exists in ink and paper.
                        This drawing depicts a man in two superimposed positions. While the arms and legs are straight
                        in
                        one, the second image shows it to be held apart. Both are inscribed in a square and circle. This
                        painting was also accompanied by notes based on Roman Architect Vitruvius’s works, where it gets
                        its
                        name from. This painting mainly demonstrates Leonardo’s depiction of the ideal proportions of
                        the
                        human body. While the inscription in a circle and square comes from the description in
                        Vitruvius’s
                        book, Leonardo did not follow the arm measurements mentioned in the same book.
                        He included the ones that he found by measuring male models in Milan. This is surely one of the
                        most
                        famous paintings of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
